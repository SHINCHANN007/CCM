Practical No.06 
Aim: Server Management 
Step 1: Creating a simple calculator using html 
Open VS Code. 
● Create a new folder (e.g. calculator-lambda). 
● Open that folder in VS Code (File → Open Folder) 
Step 2: Create the files 
Inside the folder, make two files: 
1. index.html (this is your calculator frontend) 
2. lambda_function.py 
Code: 
Step 3: Create zip file 
Open VS Code terminal 
zip -r function.zip index.html lambda_function.py 


lambda_function.py
import os

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    with open("index.html", "r") as file:
        html_content = file.read()

    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "text/html",
        },
        "body": html_content
    }


zip -r test.zip index.html lambda_function.py



Step 4: Upload to AWS Lambda 
1. Go to AWS Console → Lambda → Create function. 
2. Runtime: python.3.13 
3. Execution role: new or existing (attach 
AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole). 
4. Upload your function.zip in Code → Upload from → .zip file. 
5. Save & Deploy. 


Creating the function for the lambda function 

Successfully created function after that uploading zip file   
Uploading the zip file  


Step 5: Add the trigger and do the required configuration retrieve & use the 
Endpoint 
Using API Gateway and security should be open. 
Step 6: Access calculator app with endpoint
